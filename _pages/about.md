About me
======

I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign working under Prof. Saugata Ghose.
My research interests are in the broad area of computer architecture, with particular emphasis in memory systems, and accelerators for scientific computing. 

Prior to coming to Illinois, received a B.S. in Computer Science, B.A. in Chemistry, and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering all from the University of Rochester.
At Rochester, I studied under Dr. Engin Ipek and worked on a variety of research projects from energy-efficient DRAM systems to processing-using-memory analog architectures.

Fall 2023

I will be teaching CS 233 Honors in Fall 2023.
