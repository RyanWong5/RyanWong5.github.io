About Me
======

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) working under [Prof. Saugata Ghose](https://ghose.cs.illinois.edu/index.html).
My research interests are in the broad area of computer architecture, with particular emphasis in memory and storage systems, as well as accelerators for scientific computing and database systems. 

Prior to coming to Illinois, I received a B.S. in Computer Science, B.A. in Chemistry, and an M.S. in Electrical Engineering all from the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu/).
At U of R, I studied under [Dr. Engin Ipek](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/ipek/Home.html), where I worked on a variety of research projects ranging from energy-efficient memory systems to processing-in/using-memory.
